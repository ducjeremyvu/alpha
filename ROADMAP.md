What I've done so far 

- created a flow, reading files from data folder inserting data to duckdb 
- creating duck db table for minute data
- creating query fetching data based on date 
- importing new data happens with just one functin 'insert_minute_file_data'


work in progress: 
- analytics functions 


ideas: 


- broaden import for other assets 
- streamlit app with daily assessments 
    - need to create plotting of data
