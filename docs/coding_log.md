### ruff package

I've added ruff to the environment 

It's a package that shows how styles are off certain style guides 

```
uv run ruff check . --exclude "*.ipynb"  
```

will only scan files, no jupyter notebooks 


### refactoring

so i did some refactoring and 

### git commit format 

i wanted some unformity when it comes to git commits, so i can instantly see what was done etc.
usually i was adding everything , then adding some commit message, but it wasnt clear enough, so i wanted some framework. 

with the help of gpt, i could find something that comes with little overhead and forces good practices in communicating commits
